# 🏥 Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmission Rates

This project predicts hospital readmission likelihood using machine learning models trained on patient records. It is aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and resource utilization.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Built with: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- Dataset: Diabetes Readmission Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

## 🚀 Features
- Web-based interface for prediction
- Preprocessed and cleaned medical data
- Interactive data visualizations
- Model evaluation metrics
